## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Create `src/gesture/gesture-controller.js` to analyze landmarks.
- [x] 1.2 Implement logic to calculate rotation based on hand X position.
- [x] 1.3 Implement logic to calculate scale based on distance between two hands (updated to single hand pinch).
- [x] 1.4 Update `src/webgl/tree.js` to add methods for setting target rotation and scale.
- [x] 1.5 Implement smooth interpolation (lerp) in `ChristmasTree.animate` for updates.
- [x] 1.6 Integrate `GestureController` in `src/main.js` loop.
- [x] 1.7 Verify interaction: moving hand rotates tree, spreading hands scales tree.
